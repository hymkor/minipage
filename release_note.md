**English** / [Japanese](./release_note_ja.md) / [Top](./README.md)

v0.8.1
======
Sep 29, 2025

- Use `hymkor/goldmark-mb-headingids` instead of `hymkor/xnhttpd/idgen`
    - Fix the issue where non-alphanumeric single-byte characters in headings were included in IDs, making them incompatible with GitHub.
    - Fix the issue where, when a heading contained no characters usable for an ID, the placeholder `xheading` was used instead of `heading`.

v0.8.0
------
Sep 28, 2025

- Fix the issue where IDs were not compatible with GitHub when headers contained non-ASCII characters.

- Adjusted the style of heading anchor links to appear smaller and less intrusive
- Anchor links next to headings are now hidden when the `-anchor-text` option is not specified
- Fixed: CSS output bug: % was not escaped as %%, breaking @media print rule.

v0.5.0
------
